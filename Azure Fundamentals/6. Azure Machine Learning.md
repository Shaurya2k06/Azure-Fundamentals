## Azure AI Services

### Overview
Azure AI services are cloud-based and accessed as Azure resources. They offer consistent management, availability, and billing frameworks, similar to other Azure services (e.g., PaaS, IaaS, or managed databases).

### Key Details

1. **RESTful API Access**  
   - Azure AI services are primarily accessed via RESTful APIs. These APIs:  
     - Define how data is exchanged between the Azure AI service and applications.  
     - Ensure application functionality remains consistent after AI service updates.

2. **Authentication**  
   - Every API request is authenticated to verify:  
     - Subscription details.  
     - Sufficient permissions to access resources.  
   - Authentication involves an **endpoint** and a **resource key**.
