# Access And Security | Microsoft Azure
<b> Via Microsoft Learn</b>
## Microsoft Entra ID
Microsoft Entra ID is a directory service that enables you to sign in and access both Microsoft cloud applications and cloud applications that you develop. It is used by:
- IT Adminstarators
- Developers
- Users
- Online Service Subscribers
### Function
Authentication, Single sign on, Application Management, and Device management are some of the features Microsoft Entra ID provides.
## Microsoft Entra Domain Services
Microsoft Entra Domain Services is a service that provides managed domain services such as domain join, group policy, lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP), and Kerberos/NTLM authentication. Just like Microsoft Entra ID lets you use directory services without having to maintain the infrastructure supporting it, with Microsoft Entra Domain Services, you get the benefit of domain services without the need to deploy, manage, and patch domain controllers (DCs) in the cloud. <p> When you create a Microsoft Entra Domain Services managed domain, you define a unique namespace. This namespace is the domain name. Two Windows Server domain controllers are then deployed into your selected Azure region. This deployment of DCs is known as a replica set.

## Azure Authentication Methods
- SSO (Single Sign On) key: With SSO, you need to remember only one ID and one password. Access across applications is granted to a single identity that's tied to the user, which simplifies the security model
- Multifactor Authentication: Self Explanatory
- Passwordless Authentication: Windows Hello, MS Authentication are examples.

## External Identities
Azure External Identities is a feature that enables organizations to securely collaborate with external users, such as partners, vendors, and customers, by allowing them to access applications and resources using their existing credentials from their own identity providers. This includes B2B collaboration, where external users are invited as guest users in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), and Azure AD B2C, which allows consumers to sign in using social identities like Google or Facebook. With enhanced security measures like Conditional Access policies, streamlined user management, and self-service sign-up options, Azure External Identities facilitates efficient and secure interactions while maintaining control over access and compliance.
## Azure Conditional Access
Azure Conditional Access is a security feature within Microsoft Entra (formerly Azure Active Directory) that enables organizations to manage and secure access to applications and data through a policy-based framework. It allows administrators to define specific conditions for access based on factors such as user identity, device compliance, location, and sign-in risk, thereby supporting a Zero Trust security model. By granting or blocking access based on these conditions, and integrating seamlessly with Microsoft 365 and other SaaS applications, Conditional Access enhances security by ensuring that only authorized users and compliant devices can access sensitive resources. Organizations typically require Microsoft Entra ID Premium licenses to utilize these features effectively.

## Azure Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security feature that enables organizations to manage access to Azure resources by assigning specific permissions to users, groups, and applications based on their roles. Through role assignments, which consist of a security principal, a role definition (such as built-in roles like Owner, Contributor, and Reader), and a defined scope (like subscriptions or resource groups), RBAC promotes the principle of least privilege by ensuring users have only the necessary access to perform their tasks. It allows for centralized management of permissions, integrates seamlessly with Azure Active Directory, and supports custom roles for tailored access control, making it an essential tool for enhancing security, facilitating collaboration, and ensuring compliance within Azure environments.

## Zero Trust Model
Traditionally, corporate networks were restricted, protected, and generally assumed safe. Only managed computers could join the network, VPN access was tightly controlled, and personal devices were frequently restricted or blocked.

The Zero Trust model flips that scenario. Instead of assuming that a device is safe because itâ€™s within the corporate network, it requires everyone to authenticate. Then grants access based on authentication rather than location.

## Defense Model

- The physical security layer is the first line of defense to protect computing hardware in the datacenter.
- The identity and access layer controls access to infrastructure and change control.
- The perimeter layer uses distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection to filter large-scale attacks before they can cause a denial of service for users.
- The network layer limits communication between resources through segmentation and access controls.
- The compute layer secures access to virtual machines.
- The application layer helps ensure that applications are secure and free of security vulnerabilities.
- The data layer controls access to business and customer data that you need to protect.
